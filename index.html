                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Washington attended Pennington-Grimes Elementary School in Mount Vernon until 1968. When he was
                        14,
                        his
                        parents divorced and his mother sent him to the private preparatory school Oakland Military
                        Academy
                        in
                        New Windsor, New York. Washington later said, "That decision changed my life, because I wouldn't
                        have
                        survived in the direction I was going. The guys I was hanging out with at the time, my running
                        buddies,
                        have now done maybe 40 years combined in the penitentiary. They were nice guys, but the streets
                        got
                        them." After Oakland, he attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida from 1970 to
                        1971. He was interested in attending Texas Tech University: "I grew up in the Boys Club in Mount
                        Vernon, and we were the Red Raiders. So when I was in high school, I wanted to go to Texas Tech
                        in
                        Lubbock just because they were called the Red Raiders and their uniforms looked like ours."
                        Instead,
                        he earned a BA in Drama and Journalism from Fordham University in 1977. At Fordham, he played
                        collegiate basketball as a guard under coach P.J. Carlesimo. After a period of indecision on
                        which major to study and taking a semester off, Washington worked as creative arts director of
                        the
                        overnight summer camp at Camp Sloane YMCA in Lakeville, Connecticut. He participated in a staff
                        talent
                        show for the campers and a colleague suggested he try acting.
